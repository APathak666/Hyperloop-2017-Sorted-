Instructions before uploading sensor code to Teensy/ Arduino.

IMU-BNO055: Changes in the Adafruit_BNO055.cpp change getVector(<acceleration vector>)


BMP280: The one which we have is GY-BMP-280, so there is a slight modification before using the Adafruit_BMP280 library. In the Adafruit_BMP280.h change 

#define BMP280_ADDRESS                (0x77)

to 

#define BMP280_ADDRESS                (0x76)


MCP9808: This temperature sensor is not using the Adafruit Sensor library. Use bare-metal to write I2C signals in the bus.

Check Library for register addresses,etc.


MCP3008: This ADC uses bare-metal SPI programming. The MCP3008 library found online uses obsolete SPI bus pins and hence doesn't work.
Start Signal : 0x01

Channel 0 : 0x08
Channel 1 : 0x09
Channel 2 : 0x0A
Channel 3 : 0x0B
Channel 4 : 0x0C
Channel 5 : 0x0D
Channel 6 : 0x0E
Channel 7 : 0x0F


Pressure: Device ID is 0x28.
